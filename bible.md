# DETROIT STEEL - Series Bible

## Story Premise

Sara Kovach, 32-year-old union organizer, watches mob enforcers beat her brother Tommy to death with tire irons during a December 1974 auto strike in Detroit. Police rule it an accident. Management wins. The union backs down. Sara doesn't. Using hunting skills her father taught her in northern Michigan and a decade's knowledge of Detroit's industrial geography, she systematically dismantles the corrupt alliance that murdered Tommy. Vincent "Vinnie Wrench" Carbone runs a mob chop shop empire from the ruins of Packard Plant, using car crushers and welding torches to dispose of bodies—including dozens of union organizers over five years. Sara hunts Carbone's enforcers through frozen, abandoned factories, working up the chain one kill at a time. Winter deepens. Body count rises. She infiltrates deeper into the conspiracy until final confrontation at Packard Plant—the killing ground where Tommy and so many others were crushed. This is working-class revenge: union sister versus cartoon-evil industrial butcher in Detroit's frozen collapse.

## Protagonist Profile

**Sara Marie Kovach, 32, union organizer**

Physical: 5'7", lean and hard from factory work, short dark blonde hair kept practical, gray-blue eyes that have lost warmth. Slavic cheekbones, calloused hands, moves with efficiency not grace. Wears work boots, jeans, flannel shirts, surplus military jacket—working-class anonymous. Old scar on left forearm from childhood hunting accident.

Background: Born 1942 in Hamtramck, Detroit, to Polish immigrant autoworker family. Father worked Ford River Rouge plant thirty years, took Sara and Tommy deer hunting in Upper Peninsula every November. Taught both kids to shoot rifles (Remington 700 .30-06), track game, field dress kills, survive cold. Sara was better shot than Tommy, more patient. Graduated high school 1960, worked secretarial at Chrysler, got involved in union organizing during 1964 contract fight. Discovered she was good at it—understanding worker grievances, building solidarity, negotiating. Spent ten years learning Detroit's auto plants, industrial geography, management tactics. Tommy followed her into union work. Never married—relationships didn't survive the job's demands. Lived for the work and her brother.

Skills: Expert rifle marksmanship from twenty years hunting. Knows Detroit's industrial zones intimately—every abandoned factory, back alley, shift change, security pattern. Understands working-class culture, can blend anywhere blue-collar men gather. Patient stalker from deer hunting. Basic fieldcraft—tracking, concealment, understanding terrain. Comfortable with violence from growing up around rough men, though Tommy's murder is first time she's killed. Not a fighter—avoids hand-to-hand, uses distance and planning. Knows cars, machinery, how factories work. Can hotwire vehicles, navigate without maps, survive winter cold.

Personality: Before Tommy's death—pragmatic, focused, quietly competent. Respected by workers for lack of bullshit. After—cold, methodical, running on controlled fury. Minimal speech. Internal voice is her father's lessons mixed with grief. Doesn't monologue or philosophize. Accepts she's probably going to die doing this. No interest in survival beyond completing the mission. Hard-boiled in classic pulp sense—emotion buried deep, action replacing words. Increasingly reckless as exhaustion and infection set in.

Motivation: Tommy's murder. Watching him beaten to death while she was held back, unable to help. Guilt that her union organizing put him in danger. Rage that the system (cops, management, union leadership) won't act. Knowledge that Carbone has killed dozens of organizers the same way—Tommy wasn't first, won't be last unless she stops it. This isn't heroism. It's the only thing she can do with the grief.

Combat Capability: Excellent with rifles at distance (hunting background). Adequate with handguns (trained herself after Tommy's death). Dangerous with shotgun at close range. Poor at hand-to-hand—avoids it. Strengths are planning, patience, using terrain. Limitations: no combat experience before this, learning as she goes, shoulder wound degrades accuracy, infection causes fever/weakness late in story. She wins through preparation and determination, not superior skill.

## Villain Profile

**Vincent "Vinnie Wrench" Carbone, 43, mob enforcer and chop shop boss**

Physical: 6'2", 240 pounds, thick through chest and arms from decades of physical violence. Graying black hair slicked back with pomade, pockmarked face, broken nose (reset crooked), heavy-lidded dark eyes. Always wears mechanic's coveralls over good shirts—his signature look, grease-stained and blood-stained. Carries a 24-inch pipe wrench tucked in coverall belt, uses it for beating and killing. Hands scarred from metalwork and violence. Smells like machine oil and cigars.

Background: Born 1931 in Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood to Italian immigrant family. Father ran small auto repair shop, taught Vinnie the trade. Started stealing cars as teenager, graduated to chop shop operations in 1950s. Mob connected—worked for Detroit Partnership doing enforcement. Got nickname "Vinnie Wrench" after beating rival crew boss to death with pipe wrench in 1956, making it his signature weapon. Built chop shop empire through 1960s, took over Packard Plant ruins in 1970 when factory finally closed. Perfect location—3.5 million square feet of abandoned space, car crushers still functional, isolated. Uses it for stealing cars, parts operation, and body disposal. Detroit PD on his payroll.

Operation: Runs six chop shops across Detroit, but Packard Plant is headquarters. Crews steal 50-60 cars per week, strip them, sell parts nationwide. Also provides "disposal services" for Detroit mob—bodies go into car crushers, come out as scrap metal, shipped to smelters. Since 1972, Sterling Plant management has paid him $5,000 per month to eliminate troublesome union organizers. He's killed fourteen over three years, all made to look like accidents, muggings, or union-on-union violence. Tommy Kovach was number fourteen. Carbone has twenty men working for him directly, plus connections throughout Detroit underworld.

Evil M.O.: The car crusher is his signature. Brings victims to Packard Plant "crushing room"—massive space with industrial car crushers still operational. Beats them with his pipe wrench (not enough to kill, just to terrify and hurt), forces them into crusher cage, activates it. They die screaming as 2,000 PSI pressure compacts them with the car frame. Takes 45 seconds. Carbone watches every time, smoking a cigar. The flattened "package" (body+car) goes to smelter. No evidence. He's done this thirty-seven times. Keeps Polaroids in his office—trophies.

Personality: Jovial and chatty before violence, dead silent during. Calls everyone "pal" and "friend." Quotes his Italian grandmother's sayings. Treats the chop shop like legitimate business—has office, keeps books, manages "employees." The killing is just another service he provides. No guilt, no philosophy about it. He's a tradesman who happens to kill people. Gets genuinely offended when Sara disrupts his operation—takes it personally, like she's disrespecting his professionalism. During climax, tries to hire her (recognizes talent). Can't comprehend why she won't take money and walk away.

Quotable Dialogue: "My nonna used to say, 'Vinnie, you got a gift with your hands.'" / "This is nothing personal, pal, just business." / "You know how much a good crusher costs? Show some respect." / "I'm a professional. You? You're just pissed off. That's why you're gonna lose."

Weaknesses: Overconfident from years of operating without consequences. Doesn't take women seriously as threats—even when Sara is killing his men, he assumes it's rival mob crew. Routine-bound (visits same social clubs, eats at same restaurants). Trusts his lieutenant Rizzi too much. By the time he realizes Sara is the threat, she's already deep into his operation. Gets rattled when pattern breaks—he's used to power and control, panic makes him sloppy.

## Supporting Characters

**Tommy Kovach (deceased, Chapter 1)** — Sara's younger brother, 28. Union organizer, more idealistic than Sara. Led the Sterling Plant picket line. Beaten to death with tire irons in front of Sara. Appears in flashbacks throughout—hunting trips with their father, childhood in Hamtramck, early union work. Represents what Sara lost and why she can't stop. Dies in Chapter 1, haunts entire narrative.

**Lew Parrish, 58** — Old-guard union organizer, worked with Sara's father at River Rouge. Grizzled, missing two fingers from factory accident, smokes unfiltered Camels, drinks Old Crow. Knows Sara is hunting Carbone's crew, tries to warn her off, helps anyway because he loved her father. Provides information on mob operations, Sterling Plant corruption. Carbone's men rough him up in Chapter 13 (Sara avenges him). Survives book, appears in denouement to confirm Sterling Plant management arrests. Father-figure trying to protect Sara from herself, fails.

**Frank Rizzi, 39** — Carbone's lieutenant, runs day-to-day chop shop operations. Tall, thin, nervous energy, chain-smoker. Handles the mechanics of car theft rings and body disposal. Completely loyal to Carbone, terrified of him. Competent manager, poor fighter. Sara wounds him twice (Chapters 15, 27), he keeps coming back. Dies in Chapter 28 charging Sara with tire iron—echo of Tommy's murder. More coward than villain, but complicit in dozens of killings.

**Eddie Kusak** — First enforcer Sara kills (Chapter 4). Mid-30s, stocky, one of the men who beat Tommy to death. Low-level muscle, works for beer money and violence opportunities. Sara lures him to abandoned factory, shoots him twice. Body count begins. Dies quickly but establishes Sara's capability.

**Ray Dombrowski** — Second enforcer Sara kills (Chapter 6). Early 40s, the other man who beat Tommy. Meaner than Eddie, enjoys the work. Sara crushes him with car chassis in chop shop—poetic justice. Dies badly, screaming. Establishes Sara's willingness to make deaths painful.

**Mickey Brennan, 52** — Sterling Plant middle manager, corporate liaison to Carbone. Weak, sweating, alcoholic. Approved the payments to eliminate union organizers, kept the files. Sara corners him in Chapter 8 parking garage, he admits everything, she kills him (staged as mugging). His death alerts Carbone someone knows about the conspiracy. Corporate villain versus mob villain—both equally guilty.

## Setting Details

**Detroit, Michigan — December 1974 to January 1975**

The city is dying. Auto industry contracting, white flight accelerating, population dropped from 1.8 million (1950) to 1.2 million (1974). Entire neighborhoods abandoned. Factories closing. Crime rising. Winter is brutal—subzero temperatures, black ice, lake-effect snow. The decay is everywhere: burned-out buildings, empty lots, streetlights shot out, police response times stretching to hours in some districts.

**Sterling Plant (East Side)** — Active auto parts factory, 800 workers, running at half capacity. Built 1946, showing its age. Chain-link fencing, security gates, massive parking lots. Three-shift operation. Management offices in brick building separate from plant floor. Site of Tommy's murder at main gate picket line. Working-class territory—lunch trucks, union hall across street, corner bars where workers drink after shifts. Smell of metal grinding, machine oil, cigarette smoke. Sound of stamping presses audible blocks away.

**Packard Plant Ruins (East Grand Boulevard)** — Abandoned 1956, now Detroit's most famous ruin. 3.5 million square feet across forty acres. Multi-story factory buildings connected by bridges, car crushers and machinery left behind. Windows smashed, floors collapsed in places, graffiti everywhere. Frozen solid in winter—icicles like spears, black ice on floors, snow drifting through broken walls. Carbone controls it, uses crushing room in Building #10. Perfect battlefield—maze of rooms, multiple levels, hundreds of hiding places, treacherous footing. Smells like rust, pigeon shit, old oil. Sounds echo weirdly. Beautiful in horrible way—cathedral of American industrial collapse.

**Industrial Zones (River, Factories, Chop Shops)** — Detroit River waterfront, freight yards, smaller abandoned factories. This is Sara's hunting ground. Neighborhoods like Delray and Poletown—working-class Polish and Black, corner bars, union halls, Catholic churches, small houses on tiny lots. Cash economy, everybody knows everybody. Chop shops in warehouse districts, legitimate and criminal operations blurred. Winter makes everything harder—cars don't start, streets unplowed in poor neighborhoods, exposed skin freezes in minutes. Period detail: rotary phones in bars, metal thermoses, Detroit News sports section, muscle cars on blocks, AM radio, vinyl bench seats.

**Tactical Considerations** — Abandoned factories offer elevation (rooftop shooting positions), concealment (thousands of hiding spots), escape routes (multiple exits, broken fences). But also dangerous—unstable floors, exposure to cold, isolated (no help if cornered). Sara uses them because she understands industrial spaces and her targets don't. Winter weather is weapon—cold slows pursuers, snow shows tracks (she uses it both ways), ice makes footing treacherous, frozen metal burns exposed skin.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

Hard-boiled, working-class authentic, minimal exposition. Prose is efficient—short sentences, active verbs, no literary flourishes. This is 1976 men's adventure pulp, not modern thriller. Sara's internal voice sounds like her father's hunting lessons mixed with cold pragmatism: "Wait for the shot. Don't rush it. One bullet is all you need if you do it right." No extended introspection or emotional processing. Grief and rage expressed through action, not thought.

Dialogue is period-working-class Detroit: profanity as punctuation, ethnic slang (Polish, Italian, Black), union jargon, automotive terms. Men talk about work, money, sports, violence. Sara speaks minimally—when she does, it's direct and final. Carbone is chatty, jovial, quotes his grandmother. Contrast between his friendliness and his brutality.

Violence is graphic but functional. Describe calibers, wound effects, how bodies fall, blood on snow. Body counts matter—track running total. No torture porn or extended suffering unless story purpose (Carbone's crusher deaths establish his evil). Sara kills efficiently, sometimes brutally, never wastefully.

Pacing is relentless. Minimal scene-setting—just enough atmosphere to ground reader, then action. Chapters end on hooks. No subplots or romantic interests. Single-minded revenge drive from Chapter 1 to climax. Detroit's decay is omnipresent backdrop but not focus—this is about Sara hunting Carbone through the ruins, not sociological commentary.

Reference points: Early Executioner novels (Bolan in urban warfare), Parker novels by Richard Stark (professional criminal efficiency), Death Wish film (urban revenge), but with working-class female hunter using rifle skills versus mob enforcement.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary Weapon: Remington 700 bolt-action rifle, .30-06 Springfield** — Sara's father's deer rifle, she's used it since age fourteen. Knows it intimately—trigger pull, bullet drop at distance, how cold affects accuracy. Effective range 400+ yards with scope (3-9x variable). Loads her own ammunition using her father's equipment. Typical load: 5 rounds in magazine. Used for distance kills (guards, enforcers), precision work.

**Secondary: Remington 870 pump shotgun, 12-gauge** — Stolen from Carbone's warehouse (Chapter 18). Five-round capacity, devastating at close range (under 30 yards). Buckshot loads. Used in Packard Plant assault—tight quarters, multiple targets, no precision needed.

**Backup: Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver, .38 Special** — Purchased from pawn shop (Chapter 3). Six-round capacity, reliable, simple. Carried in waistband or jacket pocket. Used for close encounters, finishing shots, emergency situations.

**Other: Hunting knife (8-inch blade, father's), tire iron (ironic weapon choice)** — Knife for utility and silence when necessary. Tire iron used once (echo of Tommy's murder).

**Ammunition Considerations** — Sara hand-loads rifle rounds for accuracy. Carries limited ammunition (weight, bulk). Has to scavenge/steal more as story progresses. Running low on ammo is constant concern—forces careful shooting, retreat when supplies exhausted. Climax has her down to last few rounds.

**Tactical Approach** — Sara is planner, not improviser. Scouts locations, learns target patterns, sets up ambushes. Uses distance and terrain advantages. Avoids fair fights. Prefers single shots from concealment. Escalates to close-quarters only when necessary (Packard Plant assault). Weaknesses: no backup, no medical support, learning combat tactics on the job, infection degrades performance. Wins through preparation, patience, and desperation.

**Combat Style** — Efficient, brutal when needed, defensive not offensive. She's hunter, not soldier. Thinks in terms of "the shot"—one good opportunity is enough. Cold affects weapons (metal brittle, fingers numb), she compensates. Uses industrial environment as weapon—machinery, elevation, darkness, confined spaces. Final fight is hand-to-hand desperation when ammunition runs out.

## Themes

**Revenge as Working-Class Justice** — The system (police, courts, union, management) won't act, so Sara does. This isn't vigilantism as philosophy—it's practical response to institutional failure. Tommy's murder was ruled accident, Carbone pays off cops, Sterling Plant has lawyers. Working-class people don't have legal recourse against money and power. Violence is the only currency that matters. Sara doesn't philosophize about this—she just acts.

**Cost of Violence** — Sara accomplishes her mission but loses everything: her job, her home, her identity, possibly her soul. The kills get easier but the exhaustion deepens. She survives physically but is destroyed as a person. The denouement is victory without triumph—Carbone dead, union wins, but Sara drives into exile alone. Pulp revenge delivers satisfaction but extracts brutal price.

**Industrial Decay as Metaphor** — Detroit's collapse mirrors Sara's dismantling of Carbone's operation. Packard Plant—once pinnacle of American manufacturing, now ruins where bodies are crushed. The city built cars, now it crushes people. Sara hunts through this landscape of abandonment. Final confrontation in the crushing room is perfect symbolic setting: industrial machinery designed to build, now used to destroy, turned against destroyer.

**Gender as Non-Issue** — Critical: Sara is NOT written as "strong female character" commentary. She's a pulp hero who happens to be female. Her gender is practical consideration (can access certain spaces, is underestimated), not thematic focus. She doesn't prove anything about women—she kills the men who murdered her brother. Period. 1970s working-class women were tough by necessity, not statement. No meta-awareness, no modern gender politics.

# MOTOR CITY FURY - BIBLE

## Story Premise

Detroit, 1977. Casey McKenna, 22-year-old street racer and mechanic, watches her brother Danny die when his 1969 Charger explodes mid-race—brake lines cut, fuel system sabotaged. Danny refused to throw a race for Johnny Calabrese, mob-connected kingpin who controls Detroit's underground racing circuit. The cops call it mechanical failure. Casey knows it was murder. She builds the fastest car in Detroit from Danny's unfinished 1970 Camaro SS, loads a sawed-off shotgun in the trunk, and enters the racing circuit. Starting with the mechanics who sabotaged Danny's car, she races through Calabrese's organization—beating them on the track, then killing them off it. Each death sends a message. By the time Calabrese realizes Danny's little sister is destroying his empire, she's already killed a dozen of his people. The climax comes at the old Ford plant: Casey versus Calabrese's top drivers in a demolition derby with guns, ending with Calabrese burning alive in his armor-plated Cadillac. Body count: 29. Detroit's racing scene never forgets her.

## Protagonist Profile

**Casey Lynn McKenna**, 22 years old. Five-foot-six, 130 pounds, lean muscle from years of garage work. Dirty blonde hair usually pulled back in ponytail, grease perpetually under fingernails. Green eyes, angular face, small scar through left eyebrow from catching wrench at 14. Wears jeans, work boots, flannel shirts, leather jacket—working-class Detroit uniform. Drives like she was born behind a wheel because she practically was.

Grew up in McKenna's Garage on Detroit's east side. Father Sean McKenna owned the shop, specialized in muscle cars and racing engines. Both Casey and older brother Danny learned engines before they could drive—by 12 she could rebuild a carburetor, by 15 she was doing transmission work. Father taught them racing on empty factory roads, illegal street races on weekends. Danny was prodigy—natural driver, fearless, won everything. Casey was nearly as good, better mechanic. They were partners, best friends, inseparable.

By 16, Casey was racing illegally. By 20, she was top-tier female driver in Detroit circuit, known for technical precision and nerve. Made decent money racing weekends, worked garage during week. Never threw races, never backed down, earned respect in male-dominated scene. Danny going professional (underground circuit) gave her pride—her brother was legend.

Combat capability comes from two sources: racing skills (high-speed driving, tactical awareness, mechanical knowledge) and father's training (he taught both kids to shoot, handle weapons—working-class Detroit, you protect yourself). She's proficient with shotgun and handgun, comfortable with violence in abstract way (grew up around hard men, rough neighborhoods). But she's never killed anyone before story opens—that's new territory, learned through doing.

Personality: Hard-edged, working-class pragmatic, doesn't waste words. Loyal to family absolutely. Trusts through actions not promises. Comfortable in male spaces (garage, racing scene) without trying to prove anything—she belongs through skill. Emotional but controls it (crying is private, rage is fuel). Views violence as tool not pleasure—kills because necessary, not because enjoys it. Moral code simple: family first, honor debts, punish betrayal.

Motivation is pure revenge, intensely personal. Danny was her partner, protector, best friend. Watching him burn alive in sabotaged car broke something fundamental. She can't bring him back, but can't live knowing killers walk free. Not about justice (cops won't help, system's corrupt)—it's about blood debt. She'll kill everyone involved, then deal with consequences. Accepts probable death, doesn't care. Living without Danny already feels half-dead.

Current situation when story opens: Working father's garage, racing weekends, still processing Danny's death (three weeks ago). Hasn't cried since funeral. Knows it was murder, knows who ordered it, waiting for right moment to act. That moment comes when she confirms mechanic involvement—then it's war.

## Villain Profile

**Johnny "The Hammer" Calabrese**, 42 years old. Six-foot-two, 240 pounds going soft around middle—former muscle turned boss. Slicked-back black hair (too much pomade), permanent five-o'clock shadow, expensive suits that don't quite fit right. Gold pinky ring, gold watch, gold-capped tooth. Looks like mob caricature because that's exactly what he is. Drives armor-plated 1976 Cadillac Eldorado (burgundy, whitewall tires, vanity plates: HMMR 1). Always has bodyguards, always has cigar, always has angle.

Rose through Detroit mob as enforcer in 1960s—broke legs, collected debts, earned "Hammer" nickname (used actual hammer on victims' kneecaps). Smart enough to see racing money in early '70s, built underground circuit empire. Controls betting, fixes races, takes percentage from every driver. Not racer himself (too heavy, too slow) but understands it enough to exploit it. By 1977, runs tightest operation in Detroit—nobody races without his permission, nobody wins without his approval.

Criminal operation: Illegal street racing betting network (primary income), loan sharking to racers (secondary), some drug distribution through racing network (tertiary). Employs 40-50 people: mechanics who sabotage cars, enforcers who collect debts, drivers who throw races, bookies who handle money. Connected to Detroit mob families (pays tribute up, gets protection down). Untouchable—cops on payroll, judges bought, witnesses intimidated.

Signature M.O.: Car "accidents" for people who don't cooperate. Brake lines cut, fuel systems tampered, steering linkages weakened. Victims die in crashes that look mechanical. Sometimes quick (explosion, instant death), sometimes slow (crash into wall, burn alive). Calabrese doesn't do the work himself anymore—has mechanics handle it—but always watches deaths personally. Gets off on it. Stands at races, smoking cigar, watching cars explode. Power trip.

Personality: Cartoonishly evil but thinks he's businessman. Talks in mob clichés ("Nothing personal, just business"). Genuinely believes he's entitled to control racing scene—he built it, he owns it. Zero empathy, sees people as assets or obstacles. Massive ego—can't stand being defied, especially by "kids" or women. When Danny refused to throw race, took it as personal insult. Having Danny killed was business AND pleasure.

Quotable dialogue style: "Youse don't understand how things work in this town." "The Hammer always drops." "Everybody throws eventually—it's just physics." Calls everyone "kid" or "sweetheart" condescendingly. Religious references when killing ("God forgives, the Hammer don't"). Laughs at own jokes. Verbose when confident, short-tempered when challenged.

Weaknesses: Ego (can't back down from challenge, even smart move), predictability (always at his social club, always surrounded by yes-men), underestimates women (Casey's female and young, dismisses her until too late). Also creature of habit—same restaurants, same routes, same rituals. That predictability kills him.

Relationship to Casey: Doesn't know she exists until she starts killing his crew. Even then, dismisses her as "Danny's kid sister" playing revenge fantasy. By time he takes her seriously (body count 10+), she's already dismantled half his operation. His fatal mistake: killed Danny to send message about control, created Casey's singular purpose to destroy him. Perfect antagonist for her skill set—his reliance on fixed races and sabotaged cars means she beats him through pure driving skill and mechanical knowledge.

## Supporting Characters

**Sean McKenna** (52, Casey's father): Owns McKenna's Garage. Widower (wife died when Casey was 8), raised two kids alone through work ethic and engines. Tough, quiet, emotionally distant but fiercely protective. Taught Casey and Danny everything about cars and racing. Doesn't race anymore (bad knee from '60s crash) but still builds fastest engines in Detroit. Knows Casey's hunting Calabrese, doesn't try to stop her (understands blood debt), just makes sure Camaro's perfect. Fate: Kidnapped by Calabrese mid-story (leverage against Casey), rescued during warehouse raid, survives with minor injuries. Final scene picks her up from hospital, drives her out of Detroit.

**Tommy "Wrench" Sullivan** (28, garage mechanic): Works at McKenna's Garage for six years. Red-haired Irish, perpetually hungover, brilliant with transmissions. Was Danny's best friend, Casey's unofficial older brother. Provides intelligence from racing scene (knows all the gossip), helps build Camaro, doesn't ask questions when she loads weapons. Sole person Casey trusts completely. Comic relief but loyal absolutely. Fate: Survives (stays out of direct conflict, minds garage while Casey hunts), becomes manager when Sean retires.

**Paulie Rizzo** (45, Calabrese's underboss): Johnny's second-in-command. Thin, nervous, handles bookmaking operations. Smarter than Calabrese, lacks courage to challenge him. Secretly hates Johnny (treated like errand boy), fears him more. Approaches Casey mid-story offering information (locations, guard numbers) in exchange for killing Calabrese. She uses intel, doesn't trust him. Fate: Dies during final Ford plant battle (caught in crossfire, Casey doesn't save him).

**Angela "Angie" Romano** (24, bartender): Works at racing scene hangout (The Checkered Flag bar). Tough, seen everything, sympathetic to Casey (lost own brother to Calabrese's operation years ago). Provides safe space, information, occasional alibi. Not involved in violence but morally supports Casey's crusade. Small romance subplot—offers Casey way out, normal life. Casey turns it down (mission first). Fate: Survives, last person Casey sees before leaving Detroit.

**Sal Greco** (35, enforcer): Calabrese's primary muscle. Ex-boxer, broken nose, scar tissue around eyes, knuckles like concrete. Handles physical intimidation, collections, executions. Not bright but effective. First serious threat Calabrese sends after Casey. Fate: Dies chapter 9 (Casey shoots him through garage door when he tries to intimidate her). His death escalates conflict from racing to open warfare.

**Frankie Marchetti** (38, Chicago mob enforcer): Brought in from Chicago when Calabrese realizes Casey's serious threat. Professional killer, cold, efficient. Not part of racing scene—pure hunter. Drives black Lincoln, carries .45 automatic, works alone. Gives Casey first real challenge (highway ambush, she's wounded). Represents escalation—not street racers anymore, actual mob hit man. Fate: Dies chapter 15 (Casey kills his drivers, Frankie escapes wounded, dies off-page from injuries—body found later).

## Setting Details

**Detroit, 1977.** Rust Belt collapse in full effect. Auto industry dying, factories closing, neighborhoods emptying. Population fleeing suburbs, leaving urban core to decay. Entire city blocks abandoned, streetlights broken, buildings burned out from '67 riots never rebuilt. Perfect hunting ground—lawless zones where racing happens, bodies disappear, nobody asks questions.

**McKenna's Garage (East Side):** Two-bay garage, peeling paint, gravel lot, chain-link fence. Smells like motor oil, metal shavings, cigarette smoke. Cluttered workspace—tools everywhere, engine parts on shelves, racing posters on walls (vintage muscle cars, defunct speedways). Danny's Charger wreckage in back corner (Casey can't throw it out). Unfinished Camaro on lift under tarp—becomes her war machine. Sounds: pneumatic tools, metal-on-metal, classic rock radio (WRIF Detroit). Tactical: Two entrances (front bay doors, back office door), good sight lines from office window, keeps shotgun under counter.

**Detroit Street Racing Circuit (Multiple Locations):** Empty factory roads (Packard Plant area—miles of abandoned buildings, wide streets, no witnesses). I-94 service roads after midnight (straight speed runs, semi-truck traffic only). Rouge River industrial zone (refineries, warehouses, chemical plants—dangerous backdrop for chases). Belle Isle bridge approaches (technical driving, tight turns). Racing happens 11pm-4am, locations spread by CB radio, crowds 50-200 people (racers, mechanics, betters, spectators). Cash economy, handshake deals, violence simmering under surface. Period details: muscle cars (Chargers, Camaros, Chevelles, Mustangs), CB radio communication, gas $.65/gallon, races bet in hundreds not thousands.

**Calabrese's Social Club (Greektown):** Front for operations. Two-story brick building, neon sign (faded), small restaurant ground floor (Italian, mediocre food, money laundering front). Upstairs: Calabrese's office, counting rooms, meeting space. Always 4-6 guards outside, more inside. Smells like garlic, cigars, espresso. Period details: rotary pay phone outside, vinyl booths inside, Frank Sinatra on jukebox, Detroit Tigers pennants on walls. Tactical: Single street entrance (watched), back alley exit (usually locked), second-floor windows (no fire escape). Casey never attacks directly (too fortified), uses as surveillance point.

**Abandoned Ford Plant (Final Battle Location):** Massive industrial complex, closed since 1974. Acres of buildings, assembly lines rusting, broken windows, graffiti, squatter fires. Both indoor (factory floors, high ceilings, machinery obstacles) and outdoor (loading docks, parking lots, railroad spurs). Perfect demolition derby arena—tight spaces, hard obstacles, multiple levels. Sounds echo (gunshots, engines, crashes amplified). Dangerous terrain (exposed rebar, oil puddles, unstable floors). Symbolically perfect—Detroit's dead industry, Casey and Calabrese racing through corpse of American Dream.

Working-class geography throughout: Casey lives in eastside apartment (one bedroom, $150/month, bars on windows). Eats at diners (Coney Islands, 24-hour truck stops). Buys ammo at pawn shops. Gets stitched up by retired ER nurse who doesn't ask questions. No penthouses, no corporate offices—everything street-level, cash-basis, blue-collar authentic.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Hard-boiled pulp, 1970s men's adventure lineage.** Prose is efficient, working-class direct, no literary pretension. Short sentences during action, longer during planning sequences. Violence described graphically but not gratuitously—body counts matter, deaths have impact (first few kills), become routine (later kills). Tone unapologetic—Casey's revenge is justified, villains deserve death, no moral handwringing.

**Casey's internal voice:** Minimal introspection. She thinks tactically (how to approach, what weapons, escape routes) not philosophically. Emotional moments brief, buried under action focus. She doesn't question mission (Danny's death = blood debt = kill everyone involved). Guilt doesn't factor—these people murdered her brother. Internal monologue sounds like garage mechanic: "Brake line's cut clean—professional job. Fuel system tampered. They wanted it to burn." Not poetic, not verbose, mechanical assessment applied to murder.

**Dialogue style:** Working-class Detroit, 1977. Profanity natural (shit, fuck, goddamn used freely). Ethnic flavoring where appropriate (Italian mob guys, Irish mechanics, Polish bartenders—multicultural working-class city). Racing slang (blown engine, quarter-mile, street racing terminology). Period-appropriate references (Vietnam vets, Watergate cynicism, union talk, factory closures). No modern sensibilities—casual sexism exists (Casey faces it, deals with it, moves on). Characters talk like real people, not exposition machines.

**Pacing:** Fast. Chapters move—setup, action, resolution, hook for next. No lengthy descriptions breaking momentum. Action sequences detailed but efficient (3-4 pages maximum). Planning sequences brief (Casey's smart, doesn't overthink). Emotional beats quick (paragraph of grief, then back to mission). Racing scenes vivid—speed, mechanical detail, tactical choices—but not encyclopedic. Reader should feel velocity.

**Comparison tone:** Reads like 1976 Pinnacle Books Executioner novel—working-class hero, high body count, simplified morality, efficient prose, episodic structure. If Mack Bolan drove a Camaro through Detroit instead of shooting mobsters, this is that book. No meta-commentary on gender (Casey's female but that's not the point—she's RACER who happens to be woman). Pulp hero, period.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary weapon:** Remington 870 pump shotgun, 12-gauge, sawed-off barrel (18 inches—illegal but common). Kept in Camaro's trunk with box of shells (00 buckshot, 25 rounds total). Casey learned shotgun from father (home defense, taught at 16). Effective close range (garage confrontations, parking lot kills), devastating stopping power. Reloads manually, carries loose shells in jacket pocket during action. Limitations: loud, visible, requires proximity.

**Secondary weapon:** Colt .38 Special revolver (father's old service weapon from Navy, 1950s vintage). Six-shot cylinder, standard wadcutter rounds. Kept in glove compartment or waistband. Backup for shotgun failures, concealable for public situations. Casey's decent shot (father taught basic marksmanship) but not expert—hits center mass at 15 feet, struggles beyond that. Comfortable weapon, reliable, fits her hand.

**Vehicle as weapon:** 1970 Camaro SS (Danny's unfinished project). 454 big-block engine (450 hp), racing suspension, reinforced frame, roll cage. Painted flat black (no shine, no flash). Fastest thing on Detroit streets—0-60 in 5 seconds, top speed 140+. Casey uses it tactically: rams opponents, forces crashes, pins targets against walls. Camaro's her primary tool—races to get close, kills after. Trunk carries tools: tire iron (blunt weapon), road flares (fire starters), bolt cutters (chain-link fence access).

**Tactical approach:** Casey's methodical planner leveraging racing access. She enters races to get close to targets, studies patterns, strikes when vulnerable. Not improviser—she scouts locations, plans escape routes, brings right tools. Risk tolerance high but not suicidal (early chapters), becomes more reckless as body count rises (later chapters, accepting probable death). Uses mechanical knowledge advantage—knows cars intimately, exploits opponent weaknesses (bad brakes, slow acceleration, poor handling).

**Combat style:** Efficient, brutal, working-class pragmatic. No martial arts, no fancy moves—she shoots center mass, rams at speed, uses environment (walls, barriers, drops). Fights like someone who learned violence through necessity not training. Close-quarters preference (shotgun range, vehicle contact). Avoids prolonged gunfights (limited ammunition, not tactical expert). Hit fast, hit hard, leave before response arrives.

**Knowledge limitations:** Casey knows cars and basic weapons, doesn't know tactics/strategy beyond street smarts. Makes mistakes early (almost caught, leaves evidence, doesn't consider police response). Learns through doing—each kill teaches lesson, adapts methods. By Act 3, she's efficient killer, but still working-class amateur not professional assassin. That authenticity matters—she's good because she's smart and committed, not because she's superhuman.

## Themes

**Revenge as working-class justice.** Legal system won't help (cops corrupt, Calabrese connected, courts bought). Casey's violence is only available response—no lawyers, no appeals, no institutions intervening. She takes what law won't give: blood for blood. Theme explored through action not philosophy—every kill is statement that working people protect their own when system fails. Resolution: Casey gets revenge, destroys Calabrese's empire, but doesn't fix corruption (leaves Detroit unchanged, just one less villain).

**Family loyalty above all.** Danny wasn't just brother—partner, protector, best friend. His death demands response, not because abstract justice but because family bond. Casey's entire motivation is honoring that relationship through violence. Supporting characters (father, Tommy) respect mission because they understand loyalty code. Betrayal (mechanics who sabotaged Danny) is ultimate sin requiring ultimate punishment. Manifests in: Casey's single-minded focus, refusal to quit despite danger, acceptance of probable death (living without Danny already half-dead).

**Decay and survival in dying city.** Detroit 1977 is character itself—abandoned factories, empty streets, institutions failing. Racing scene exists in power vacuum (no law, no order, just strongest survive). Casey and Calabrese both products of this environment—she fights through it, he exploits it. Action sequences use decay tactically (abandoned plants, empty roads, industrial ruins). Theme resolution: Casey leaves Detroit because city itself is dying, nothing left to save. She got revenge but place that made her is corpse.

**Gender as non-issue.** Casey's female but that's not story focus—she's racer/mechanic who happens to be woman. Faces period-typical sexism (dismissed as "girl," underestimated by villains) but uses it tactically (opponents don't see her coming). No modern Strong Female Character™ meta-commentary—she's pulp hero in tradition of Executioner/Death Merchant. Proves herself through body count not speeches. Theme simply: competence matters, gender doesn't. 1970s setting allows authentic period attitudes without modern apologizing.

# MOTOR CITY FURY - MASTER OUTLINE

## ACT 1: SETUP (Chapters 1-8)

### Chapter 1: "The Fireball"

Cold open—illegal street race, Detroit factory roads, October 1977, 11pm. Casey McKenna (22) watches from crowd as brother Danny races his 1969 Charger. Leading pack, then explosion mid-turn—fireball, car flips, crashes into wall. Casey runs to wreckage, holds Danny as he dies. She knows immediately it wasn't mechanical failure—too perfect, too timed. Through tears she sees Johnny Calabrese watching from burgundy Cadillac across street, smoking cigar, smirking. He makes eye contact, tips head mockingly, drives away. Danny dies in her arms. Racing crowd disperses fast (cops coming). Casey stays with body until police arrive. Hook: She examines wreckage while waiting—notices cut brake line. Murder. Body count: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 2: "McKenna Blood"

Flashback chapter—Casey and Danny's childhood at McKenna's Garage. Father Sean taught both kids engines, racing, survival. Mother died when Casey was 8 (cancer), father raised them through work. Danny natural prodigy, Casey nearly as good but better mechanic. They raced together illegally from teens, partners. Danny went professional underground circuit at 20, became legend by 25. Casey worked garage, raced weekends, lived in Danny's shadow happily. Close relationship established—inside jokes, shared history, mutual protection. Danny's personality: fearless, loyal, never threw races, made good money honestly. Week before death, mentioned Calabrese approached him about throwing big race, Danny refused. Casey didn't think much of it then. Now replaying conversation, realizes it was death sentence. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 3: "Evidence"

Three days after funeral. Casey investigates. Visits police impound, examines Charger wreckage. Brake line cut clean—professional job. Fuel system tampered—accelerant added. Racing crew confirms: Calabrese approached Danny week before, Danny refused publicly (embarrassed Calabrese in front of other racers). Everyone knows it was hit, nobody talks (Calabrese mob-connected, controls circuit, kills people who defy him). Casey talks to Tommy (garage mechanic, Danny's best friend)—he names mechanics: Tony Rizzo and Mike Chen did sabotage work for Calabrese regularly. Tommy warns Casey: cops won't help (Calabrese owns them), going after him is suicide. She doesn't care. Visits Danny's apartment, finds racing trophies, photos of them as kids, unfinished Camaro project blueprints. Takes blueprints. Decision forming. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 4: "The Hammer's House"

Casey confronts Calabrese at his social club (Greektown). Walks in midday, demands to see him. Guards try to remove her, she makes scene. Calabrese comes down (amused—Danny's kid sister), brings her to office. She accuses him directly: "You killed my brother." He plays innocent, offers condolences, suggests Danny's death "unfortunate mechanical failure—racing's dangerous, sweetheart." His eyes tell different story—enjoys her pain. When Casey presses, threatens police, he laughs. Owns the cops, owns the judges, owns Detroit. "Your brother should've taken the deal. Pride's expensive." Casey lunges, guards grab her, throw her out physically (roughed up, bruised). She sits in parking lot, watching Calabrese through window smoking cigar, surrounded by yes-men. Makes final decision: legal system won't help, only option is blood. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 5: "Building War"

Two-week montage. Casey builds the Camaro from Danny's unfinished project. 1970 Camaro SS, flat black paint, 454 big-block engine (450hp), racing suspension, reinforced frame, roll cage. Works 16-hour days, father helps silently (knows what she's planning, doesn't try to stop—understands blood debt). Tommy provides parts, doesn't ask questions. Garage becomes workshop and armory: Camaro on lift, weapons laid out—father's Remington 870 shotgun (sawed-off), .38 revolver, boxes of ammunition, tire iron, road flares, bolt cutters. Casey test-drives Camaro on empty factory roads, midnight. It's monster—fastest thing she's driven. Practices high-speed turns, ramming techniques using junked cars. Also practices shooting—hasn't killed anyone, needs to be ready. Final night before action: sleeps in garage, Camaro finished, weapons loaded. Ready. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 0.

### Chapter 6: "First Blood"

Casey enters underground race using Danny's connections. Target: Tony Rizzo (mechanic who sabotaged Danny's car—confirmed through racing gossip). Race location: Packard Plant area, midnight, quarter-mile straightaway. Tony drives souped-up Mustang, confident. Casey in Camaro, cold fury. Race starts—she stays close, then at finish line doesn't brake. Rams his Mustang from behind at 80mph, sends him sideways into concrete barrier. His car crumples like accordion, he screams. Casey stops, walks to wreckage. Tony alive but crushed, begging. She says nothing, drives away. He dies before ambulance arrives. Racing scene shocked—Danny's sister just killed someone, wasn't accident. Word spreads. Calabrese hears, assumes racing accident (common enough). Doesn't connect yet. Body count chapter: 1 (Tony Rizzo). Running total: 1.

### Chapter 7: "Circuit Legend"

Casey races again, different location. Not killing—just establishing presence. Wins three races over week, beating top Detroit drivers. Camaro's too fast, her skills undeniable. Circuit starts talking about "Danny's sister"—drives like demon, fearless, something wrong with her eyes (cold, dead). Calabrese attends race, sees her win. Still doesn't take seriously—she's 22, female, what's she gonna do? His underboss Paulie warns him: "She killed Rizzo." Calabrese dismisses: "Racing accident, happens." Watches Casey collect winnings, doesn't approach. She sees him watching, makes eye contact, doesn't flinch. Message sent: I'm here, I'm not afraid. Calabrese laughs it off. Mistake. Casey plans next kill. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 1.

### Chapter 8: "Point of No Return"

Casey kills second mechanic—Mike Chen (other saboteur). Races him, beats him easily. Post-race meetup at diner parking lot (racers gather, collect bets, talk). Mike walking to his car, Casey follows. Empty corner of lot, she pulls shotgun from Camaro trunk, calls his name. He turns, she shoots—00 buckshot, close range, center mass. He flies backward, dead before hitting ground. Everyone scatters (gunshot in public). Casey drives away calmly, adrenaline dump hits later. This was execution, not accident—can't pretend anymore. Calabrese gets word within hour: Danny's sister shot Mike in parking lot, witnesses everywhere. Now he understands—she's hunting his crew. Puts word out: find her, stop her. Sends enforcer Sal to McKenna's Garage. Casey's fully committed—two dead, war declared, no going back. Sleeps in Camaro that night, shotgun in lap. Body count chapter: 1 (Mike Chen). Running total: 2.

## ACT 2: ESCALATION (Chapters 9-23)

### Chapter 9: "The Enforcer"

Calabrese sends Sal Greco (primary muscle, ex-boxer) to intimidate Casey at garage. Dawn, she's working on Camaro. Sal arrives with two guys, pounds on bay door, demands she come out, stop killing Calabrese's people, "or else." Casey's ready—knew this was coming. Shotgun loaded, positioned behind office door. Sal tries to kick in door, she fires through it—buckshot tears through wood, hits him center mass. He drops. Two guys run. Casey steps out, confirms Sal dead, drags body inside (police later, can't leave evidence). Calls Tommy—he arrives, they load body into Sal's own car, dump in river (Rouge River industrial area, common body dump). Returns to garage, boards up door, knows escalation coming. Father arrives evening, sees damage, says nothing—just brings her thermos of coffee, box of shells. Understands. Body count chapter: 1 (Sal Greco). Running total: 3.

### Chapter 10: "Triple Play"

Casey goes on offensive—kills three Calabrese enforcers in 24 hours. (1) Gas station hit: enforcer fueling car, she rams him with Camaro, pins him against pump, crushes him, drives away. (2) Apartment ambush: second enforcer home sleeping, she breaks in, shoots him with .38 (two rounds, headshots—close range, execution). (3) Race kill: third enforcer entered race (Calabrese sent him to kill her during race), she forces him off road into ravine at 90mph, his car flips multiple times, explodes at bottom. Three deaths, one day. Message clear: she's hunting them, nowhere safe. Racing circuit terrified—she's using races as cover for assassinations. Calabrese loses control of narrative—drivers refuse to race against her, enforcers request Chicago transfers, bookies nervous. He's hemorrhaging people and credibility. Body count chapter: 3 (three enforcers). Running total: 6.

### Chapter 11: "Chicago Speed"

Calabrese brings in professional driver from Chicago—"Snake" Morrison, known killer, drives Dodge Challenger. $10k bounty: race Casey, kill her during. Snake confident (40 kills, never lost race to woman). Challenges Casey publicly over CB radio. She accepts. Race location: I-94 service road, midnight, high-speed run. They race—Snake tries ramming, shooting (carries .45 while driving), running her off road. Casey better driver, Camaro faster. She outmaneuvers him, gets behind, rams his Challenger at 100mph. He loses control, wraps around concrete support pillar—instant death, car accordion. Casey doesn't stop, doesn't look back. Racing scene witnesses whole thing, word spreads: Chicago's best couldn't stop her. Calabrese panicking now—if professionals can't kill her, who can? Body count chapter: 1 (Snake Morrison). Running total: 7.

### Chapter 12: "Follow the Money"

Casey shifts targets—goes after Calabrese's money. Hits two bookies in one night. (1) Counting house (apartment where bets collected): she kicks in door, shoots bookie and guard (shotgun, close quarters, both dead instantly). Takes $8k cash, leaves bodies. (2) Second bookie leaving bar: runs him over in parking lot (Camaro at speed, hits him full-on), reverses over body to ensure death. Doesn't take money—sends message. Calabrese's betting operation disrupted—bookies refuse to work, money flow stops, racers can't place bets. Circuit chaos. Calabrese losing empire foundation—no betting, no races, no income, no control. He fortifies position, calls Chicago for serious help. Casey doesn't care—keeps hunting. Body count chapter: 3 (two bookies, one guard). Running total: 10.

### Chapter 13: "Death Race"

Major organized race—$50k winner-take-all, supposed to draw Casey out. She enters. Calabrese has four drivers in race (all armed, plan to crash/kill her). Race through Detroit industrial zone—Rouge River refineries, warehouses, chemical plants. Becomes running gun battle at speed. Casey shoots two drivers through windows while racing (shotgun, one-handed, difficult shots—gets lucky). Both crash fatally. Third driver tries ramming, she outmaneuvers, forces him into warehouse wall at 70mph—car crumples, driver dies on impact. Fourth driver wounded (she clipped him), crashes escaping, survives. Race crowd goes insane—this is legendary, never seen anything like it. Casey wins, collects $50k, leaves. Calabrese watching from distance, knows he's losing. Body count chapter: 3 (three drivers killed). Running total: 13.

### Chapter 14: "The Professional"

Calabrese brings in Frankie Marchetti—Chicago mob enforcer, serious muscle, professional killer. Not racer, pure hunter. Frankie arrives Detroit, studies Casey's pattern (races, garage, father's house, known hangouts). Starts hunting her outside races—her apartment (she's not there), garage (Tommy warns her), father's house (Sean has shotgun ready). Casey realizes she's being hunted by professional, goes mobile—lives out of Camaro, sleeps in abandoned buildings, stays moving. Paranoid, exhausted, running on adrenaline. Still enters races (only way to draw out Calabrese's people), but constantly watching for ambush. Frankie patient, sets trap. This chapter setup, no kills—building tension. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 13.

### Chapter 15: "Highway Ambush"

Midpoint confrontation. Frankie ambushes Casey on I-75, midday traffic. Three-car team: Frankie driving Lincoln, two chase cars (Chevy Novas). High-speed chase through Detroit freeways—shooting while driving, ramming at 80mph, civilians scattering. Casey kills three drivers: rams first Nova into median barrier (driver dies in crash), shoots second Nova driver through windshield (lucky shot, .38 revolver—driver loses control, crashes into semi-truck, massive pileup). Frankie's Lincoln chases her onto surface streets. Running gun battle, she's hit—bullet grazes shoulder (painful, bleeding, not fatal). She rams Frankie's Lincoln into parked cars, escapes while he's stunned. Frankie survives, wounded, escapes on foot. Later dies from injuries (found dead in alley—bled out). Casey patches shoulder wound herself, realizes she's not invincible. First time she's injured. Shaken but continues. Body count chapter: 4 (three drivers, Frankie bleeds out). Running total: 17.

### Chapter 16: "Blood and Repairs"

Casey recovering. Hides Camaro in abandoned Packard Plant building, treats shoulder wound (bourbon for antiseptic, duct tape and gauze). Exhausted, feverish from infection, hasn't slept properly in days. Tommy finds her (she called, needed help), brings antibiotics, food, clean clothes. He begs her to stop—"You got 17 of them, Danny's avenged, leave town." She refuses: Calabrese still alive, debt not paid. Tommy helps repair Camaro (bullet holes in body, damaged suspension from ramming), restocks ammunition. Father visits, doesn't speak—just sits with her hour, then leaves envelope of cash ($2k). Casey reviews mental list: killed 17, but Calabrese untouched, more crew remain. Needs to push harder. Accepts probable death but committed to taking them all. Rests two days, then back to hunting. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 17.

### Chapter 17: "Bleeding the Empire"

Casey resumes killing—targets Calabrese's remaining bookies and drivers. Three kills over week: (1) Bookie shot at his apartment (broke in, .38 to head, execution-style). (2) Driver raced and killed (forced off road into concrete barrier at speed). (3) Second bookie run over leaving restaurant (Camaro hit-and-run). Each death costs Calabrese reputation, money, control. Other racing crews smell weakness, move into his territory. Bookies independent now, races happen without his permission, drivers don't pay tribute. Empire crumbling. Calabrese desperate, fortified in social club with remaining dozen enforcers, paranoid. Makes fatal mistake (next chapter): decides to force Casey's hand by grabbing leverage—her father. Body count chapter: 3 (two bookies, one driver). Running total: 20.

### Chapter 18: "Hostage"

Calabrese's crew kidnaps Sean McKenna from garage, takes him to warehouse (River Rouge area). Leaves message at garage: "Stop killing my people or your old man dies slow." Tommy finds message, calls Casey. She's ice-cold furious—Calabrese crossed line, touched family. Calls social club from payphone, Calabrese answers. She tells him: "You're dead regardless. Hurting my father just means you die screaming." Hangs up. Tracks down messenger who left note (low-level guy, terrified), interrogates him (threatens with shotgun), gets warehouse location. Shoots messenger anyway (can't leave witnesses—two rounds .38, body in dumpster). Plans warehouse raid. Tommy offers help, she refuses—"This is mine." Loads Camaro: shotgun, .38, extra ammunition, tire iron. Drives to warehouse, night. Body count chapter: 1 (messenger). Running total: 21.

### Chapter 19: "Warehouse Rescue"

Casey raids warehouse. Six guards holding Sean in back office. She goes loud—drives Camaro through chain-link fence, parks outside loading dock, approaches on foot. Guards hear her coming, defensive positions. She uses darkness, industrial clutter—shoots two guards from shadows (shotgun, both killed). Gun battle erupts—remaining four guards return fire, she takes cover behind machinery. Close-quarters combat: shoots third guard coming around corner, fourth guard she kills with tire iron (brutal, smashes skull). Fifth guard runs, she shoots him in back. Sixth guard surrenders, she executes him anyway (no witnesses). Finds Sean tied in office, beaten but alive (broken ribs, black eye, defiant—didn't tell them anything). She cuts him loose, helps him to Camaro, drives to hospital. Leaves him at ER entrance (anonymous drop—can't stay, cops involved). Watches from distance as he's wheeled inside, then disappears. Body count chapter: 6 (six guards). Running total: 27.

### Chapter 20: "Fortress Calabrese"

Calabrese fortifies position after warehouse disaster. Brings in final reinforcements from Chicago (dozen enforcers), armor-plates his Cadillac, guards social club 24/7, sleeps upstairs, paranoid. Casey scouts—too defended, direct assault suicide. Needs different approach. Watches for days, notes patterns: Calabrese moves between social club and girlfriend's apartment (two blocks away), always convoy of three cars, always armed guards. Still predictable though—same route, same times. Casey formulates plan: can't kill him in fortress, need to draw him out. Remembers racing—Calabrese's ego, can't resist challenge. Hatches idea: challenge him publicly to final race, winner-take-all. He'll accept (pride, can't back down before circuit). That's her opening. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 27.

### Chapter 21: "Dark Moment"

Casey almost caught. Kills Calabrese enforcer leaving bar (ambush, shotgun), but cops arrive fast—someone called it in. High-speed chase through Detroit—three police cars pursuing Camaro. She loses them through industrial maze (knows streets better, Camaro faster), hides in abandoned building. Camaro damaged from chase (blown tire, cracked windshield, engine overheating). Police search area, she waits in darkness holding shotgun, exhausted. They pass close, don't find her. After they leave, she assesses: low on ammunition (eight shotgun shells, twelve .38 rounds left), Camaro damaged, wounded (shoulder still healing), physically exhausted, emotionally depleted. Considers quitting—she's killed 28, maybe that's enough. Then remembers Danny's face burning in Charger, Calabrese's smirk. Can't quit. Spends night repairing Camaro using salvaged parts, reloading every weapon. Dawn: ready for final push. Body count chapter: 1 (enforcer). Running total: 28.

### Chapter 22: "The Challenge"

Casey issues public challenge over CB radio (racing channel everyone monitors). Calls out Calabrese directly: "You killed my brother, I killed your crew. Let's finish it. Old Ford plant, tomorrow midnight, final race. You and your best drivers versus me. Winner takes everything, loser dies." Circuit goes silent, then explodes—everyone talking, biggest event in Detroit racing history. Calabrese hears challenge at social club, enforcers wait for response. His ego won't let him refuse (entire circuit listening, backing down means weakness). He accepts: "Tomorrow midnight, little girl. Bring a coffin." Both sides prepare. Casey works on Camaro final time—checks every system, loads all remaining weapons, writes letter to father (apologizing, explaining, saying goodbye—leaves it in garage). Sleeps in driver's seat. Calabrese brings four best drivers (all killers, all armed) plus security convoy. Setup for final showdown. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 28.

### Chapter 23: "Last Preparations"

Dawn before final race. Casey wakes in Camaro, drives through Detroit one last time—past McKenna's Garage (closed, father at hospital still), past Danny's apartment (empty), past racing spots where they grew up. Goodbye tour. Accepts she's probably dying tonight—28 kills, massive odds, Calabrese bringing small army. Doesn't care. Debt will be paid regardless. Stops at Danny's grave (small ceremony, says what she needs to say). Drives to old Ford plant early, scouts territory—massive complex, indoor and outdoor spaces, perfect demolition derby arena. Notes obstacles, escape routes, kill zones. Picks starting position. Waits. Afternoon: Calabrese arrives with convoy—four drivers (professional killers), six security guards, Paulie (underboss). Sets up opposite end of plant. Both sides waiting for midnight. Circuit spreads word—50+ spectators arrive to watch (safe distance). Tension building. Midnight approaches. Casey starts Camaro, revs engine. Across plant: four cars rev in response. It's time. Body count chapter: 0. Running total: 28.

## ACT 3: RECKONING (Chapters 24-30)

### Chapter 24: "First Blood"

Midnight. Race starts—but it's not race, it's war. Five cars (Casey's Camaro versus four opponent vehicles: two Camaros, Challenger, Mustang) through Ford plant complex, indoor and outdoor. Immediate chaos—opponents try boxing her in, she uses speed and maneuverability. First kill: she rams opponent Camaro sideways into support pillar at 60mph—driver's side crumples, he's crushed instantly. Car catches fire, explodes. Spectators screaming (this is insane). Three opponents left, chasing her through factory floor—tight spaces, machinery obstacles, broken glass. She shoots while driving (shotgun one-handed through window), misses but forces them to scatter. Running battle through assembly lines, sparks flying, engines roaring. Ends chapter with her escaping to outdoor section, three cars still pursuing. Body count chapter: 1 (first driver). Running total: 29.

### Chapter 25: "The Gauntlet"

Chase continues outdoors—parking lots, loading docks, railroad spurs. Second kill: opponent Challenger tries ramming her, she brakes hard, he overshoots, she T-bones him at intersection—his car flips, rolls three times, lands upside-down. Driver hanging from seatbelt, dazed. Casey stops, approaches on foot, shoots him through window (.38, headshot—mercy kill or execution, unclear). Camaro damaged from ramming (front end crumpled, radiator leaking). Two opponents left, both circling her. Gun battle while stationary—she takes cover behind Camaro, they fire from their cars. She shoots out windshield of Mustang, driver ducked—misses. Low on ammunition now (two shotgun shells, four .38 rounds). Has to get mobile, staying still means death. Rams through their blockade, escapes back into factory. They follow. Body count chapter: 1 (Challenger driver). Running total: 30.

### Chapter 26: "Into the Pit"

Factory interior, multi-level—she leads them through catwalks, ramps, loading areas. Third kill: opponent Camaro chasing her up ramp, she spins 180 at top, drives at him head-on (game of chicken). He swerves, crashes through railing—car falls 30 feet onto factory floor, lands on roof, crushes driver instantly. Gasoline spreads, ignites—fireball. One opponent left: Mustang driven by Calabrese's best driver, Tony "The Hammer Jr." (related to Calabrese, skilled and vicious). Epic chase ensues—through tight corridors, both cars damaged, both drivers wounded (Casey's shoulder bleeding again, Tony shot in side—unknown when). They're evenly matched now, comes down to who wants it more. Casey remembers Danny, finds reserve. Body count chapter: 1 (third driver). Running total: 31.

### Chapter 27: "The Hammer Falls"

Casey versus Tony through factory ruins, both cars barely functional, both drivers on edge of collapse. He's got size advantage (heavier car), she's got skill. Cat-and-mouse through machinery, then she spots it—dead-end corridor, loading dock beyond. Gets idea. Lets him chase her down corridor, he thinks he's got her trapped. She accelerates toward dead-end, he follows confident. Last second she handbrake-turns sideways, slides to stop. He can't react fast enough—Mustang hits her Camaro side-on at 50mph. Both cars entangled, momentum carries them through wall onto loading dock. They hang over edge, thirty-foot drop. Cars teetering. Tony unconscious from impact. Casey conscious barely, crawls out her window. Cars slide, fall—crash below, explode. Massive fireball. She's on loading dock ledge, watches them burn. Tony dies in explosion. She climbs down. Body count chapter: 1 (Tony "The Hammer Jr."). Running total: 32.

### Chapter 28: "The Hammer's Judgment"

Casey on foot now, Camaro destroyed. Wounded, limping, exhausted. Finds Calabrese trying to escape—running to his armor-plated Cadillac parked outside plant, Paulie driving. Security guards dead (killed in earlier crossfire or fled). She spots them from distance. No weapons left—shotgun in burning Camaro, .38 empty. Improvises: finds factory truck (old Ford F-250, keys in ignition), hot-wires it, chases Calabrese. He sees her coming in rearview, panics—"Drive! DRIVE!" Paulie accelerates, Casey pursues. Chase through industrial area, Cadillac fast but truck determined. She rams Cadillac repeatedly, forces it off road into refinery section. Cadillac crashes into fuel storage tanks, Calabrese and Paulie stumble out. Casey finds road flare in truck, lights it, approaches on foot. Calabrese begs, offers money, tries to run. She throws flare at fuel tanks—massive explosion, fireball engulfs Cadillac and both men. Calabrese burns alive, screaming. She watches until screaming stops. Body count chapter: 2 (Calabrese, Paulie). Running total: 34.

### Chapter 29: "Aftermath"

Casey staggers from explosion, burns on arms, bleeding from multiple wounds. Calabrese's last two security guards (were in follow car) find her, try to kill her (finish job). She's unarmed, wounded, should be dead. But they hesitate (she's legend now, they're scared). She doesn't—grabs tire iron from ground, kills first guard (brutal beating, smashes skull), takes his .45 pistol, shoots second guard (three rounds center mass). Both dead. Collapses from exhaustion, blood loss, shock. Spectators emerge from hiding (watched whole thing), racing crew finds her unconscious. They load her into car (Tommy arrived—heard everything over CB), drive her to hospital. Anonymous drop, they tell ER "car accident victim," leave before cops arrive. Racing scene protects her—nobody talks, nobody IDs her. Casey wakes three days later, hospital bed, under false name. Body count chapter: 2 (two guards). Running total: 36 (final count).

### Chapter 30: "Motor City Ghost"

Casey recovers in hospital week, checks self out against medical advice. Tommy picks her up, drives her to garage. Father there (released from hospital days before), says nothing—just hugs her (rare emotion). Racing circuit knows everything: Danny's sister destroyed Calabrese's empire, killed 36 people, avenged her brother in legendary fashion. She's myth now. But Casey's done—can't stay Detroit (too many bodies, too many questions, cops sniffing around). Sells garage to Tommy (he'll run it), takes money ($50k from final race plus savings). Says goodbye to father (tearful, he understands—city's got nothing for her now). Leaves Detroit, drives west. Epilogue six months later: Casey in Los Angeles, working normal mechanic job (import shop, quiet life). Lives in small apartment, keeps low profile. On wall: photo of Danny, keys to 1970 Camaro (replacement she rebuilt, can't help herself). She's out, but racing's still in blood. Some things you never forget. Detroit remembers her—"Motor City Fury," the girl who beat them all and burned it down. Body count chapter: 0. Final total: 36.

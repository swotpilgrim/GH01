POV: Casey McKenna, first person
Setting: Abandoned Packard Plant building, McKenna's Garage
Time: Day after highway ambush, Thursday afternoon into evening

**Purpose:** Casey's recovery and moment of doubt—physical/emotional lowest point before final push.

**Beats:**
- Casey hides Camaro in abandoned Packard Plant, treats shoulder wound herself (bourbon, duct tape, gauze), feverish from infection
- Hasn't slept properly in days, exhausted, body giving out, calls Tommy for help
- Tommy arrives with antibiotics, food, clean clothes, begs her to stop—"17 dead, Danny's avenged, leave town"
- Casey refuses—Calabrese still breathing, debt unpaid—Tommy helps repair Camaro (bullet holes, damaged suspension)
- Father visits silently, sits with her an hour, leaves envelope of $2k, she accepts she might die but commits to finishing

**Dialogue Topics:** Tommy's pleading to stop and Casey's refusal, practical repair discussions about Camaro damage, father's silent presence (no words needed), Casey's feverish internal dialogue about Danny's face haunting her.

**Emotional Arc:** Physical and emotional rock bottom—wounded, feverish, doubting herself briefly, but father and Tommy's support reminds her why she's doing this, hardens final resolve.

**Key Details:** Packard Plant interior (empty offices, broken windows, pigeon shit, cold December), wound infection symptoms (fever, red streaks, pain), Camaro damage inventory (three bullet holes, cracked windshield, front suspension bent), antibiotics and bourbon, father's envelope ($2k in twenties), two-day recovery period.

**Purpose:** Casey resumes systematic destruction of Calabrese's operation—money and muscle.

**Beats:**
- Recovered enough to move, Casey targets remaining bookies and drivers methodically
- First kill: bookie at apartment (break-in, .38 to head, execution-style, takes nothing)
- Second kill: driver during race (forces off road into concrete barrier at speed, standard tactic)
- Third kill: bookie leaving restaurant (Camaro hit-and-run, runs over him twice)
- Each death costs Calabrese reputation and territory—other crews moving in, circuit operating independently now
- Calabrese fortified in social club, paranoid, empire crumbling around him

**Dialogue Topics:** Racing circuit chatter about Calabrese losing control, other crew leaders discussing territory grabs, Casey's minimal interactions (cold, focused), Calabrese's paranoid rants to remaining crew about "that bitch."

**Emotional Arc:** Casey back in operational mode—cold, efficient, kills routine now (not emotional anymore), satisfaction watching Calabrese's empire collapse, knows endgame approaching.

**Key Details:** Three kill locations with specific details (apartment in Hamtramck, race at Belle Isle, restaurant in Dearborn), body count tracking (running total: 20), other racing crews mentioned (Polish crew from west side, black crew from downtown), Calabrese's deteriorating control visible through circuit gossip.

- Tommy finds message, calls Casey, she's ice-cold furious—this crossed ultimate line
- Casey calls Calabrese from payphone, tells him directly: "You're dead regardless—hurting my father just means you die screaming"

**Beats:**
- Calabrese fortifies after warehouse disaster—brings in Chicago reinforcements (dozen enforcers), armor-plates Cadillac, guards social club 24/7
- Casey scouts for three days from distance—too defended for direct assault, needs different approach
- Observes patterns: Calabrese moves between club and girlfriend's apartment (two blocks), always convoy of three cars, heavily armed
- Still predictable though—same routes, same times, ego-driven habits
- Casey formulates plan: can't kill him in fortress, must draw him out through racing challenge—his pride won't let him refuse public challenge

- Stops at Danny's grave (small cemetery, east side), kneels, tells him what she's done and what she's about to do, asks if he'd forgive her
- Drives to old Ford plant early afternoon, scouts alone—massive abandoned complex, indoor/outdoor spaces, perfect demolition arena
- Notes tactical details (obstacles, escape routes, kill zones), picks starting position (loading dock with good sight lines)
- Waits. Afternoon: Calabrese arrives with convoy—four drivers, six guards, Paulie (underboss), sets up opposite end
- Circuit spectators arrive (50+ people at safe distance), tension building, both sides waiting for midnight, Casey in Camaro engine idling

**Purpose:** Opening salvo of finale—first kill, establishes chaos and stakes, pure action.

**Beats:**
- Midnight, engines rev, "race" begins—immediate chaos, five cars through Ford plant, not racing but war
- Four opponents try boxing Casey in, she uses speed and tight maneuvering through assembly floor
- First kill: rams opponent Camaro sideways into support pillar at 60mph—driver's side crumples, he's crushed, car catches fire and explodes
- Spectators screaming (witnessing vehicular combat), three opponents still chasing through factory floor
- Gun battle while driving—Casey shoots shotgun one-handed through window (misses but forces scatter), running battle through machinery and obstacles
- Escapes to outdoor section, three cars pursuing, Camaro damaged slightly, adrenaline maxed

**Dialogue Topics:** Engines roaring (sound description more than dialogue), opponents shouting to each other coordinating attack, spectators' distant reactions, Casey's internal tactical narration (positioning, ammunition count, damage assessment).

**Emotional Arc:** Pure operational focus—no fear, no hesitation, in the zone, exhilaration of combat (she's good at this), cold satisfaction at first kill (one down, four to go).

Time: Continuous from Chapter 24, minutes later

**Purpose:** Second kill, escalating vehicle damage, ammunition depleting, raising stakes.

**Beats:**
- Chase continues outdoors through parking lots and loading areas, three opponents coordinating better
- Challenger tries ramming Casey, she brakes hard, he overshoots, she T-bones him at intersection—car flips, rolls three times, lands upside-down
- Casey stops, approaches on foot, driver hanging from seatbelt dazed, she shoots him through window (.38, headshot—mercy or execution unclear)
- Camaro damaged from T-bone (front end crumpled, radiator leaking, handling compromised), two opponents circling
- Gun battle while stationary—she takes cover behind Camaro, they fire from cars, she shoots out Mustang windshield (misses driver)
- Low on ammunition (six shotgun shells, ten .38 rounds left), has to get mobile or die, rams through blockade, escapes back to factory interior

**Dialogue Topics:** Opponent drivers coordinating attack over radio, Casey's ammunition tracking (counts remaining rounds aloud), internal monologue about damaged Camaro handling, calculation about staying mobile versus taking cover.

**Emotional Arc:** Adrenaline still high, frustration at Camaro damage (losing speed advantage), brief moment of fear when pinned down (could die here), survival instinct overrides, keeps moving.

**Beats:**
- Casey leads remaining two opponents (Camaro and Mustang) through multi-level factory interior—catwalks, ramps, vertical spaces
- Drives up loading ramp to second level, opponent Camaro follows, she spins 180 at top, drives at him head-on (game of chicken at 40mph)
- He swerves to avoid collision, crashes through safety railing, car falls 30 feet onto factory floor below, lands on roof
- Driver crushed instantly, gasoline spreads from ruptured tank, ignites—massive fireball visible through factory windows
- One opponent left: Mustang driven by Tony "The Hammer Jr." (Calabrese's relative, best driver, vicious)
- Epic chase begins through tight factory corridors, both cars severely damaged, both drivers wounded, evenly matched now

**Dialogue Topics:** Tony's shouted threats (family honor, going to kill her slow), Casey's grim responses (minimal, focused), internal narration about ammunition (running critical low), tactical assessment of final opponent (he's good, this will be close).

**Emotional Arc:** Savage satisfaction at third kill (environmental advantage working), respect for final opponent's skill (first real challenge), acceptance this might be where she dies, determination to take him with her.

- Casey versus Tony through factory ruins, cat-and-mouse through machinery, both cars barely functional
- Tony has weight advantage (heavier Mustang), Casey has skill and desperation
- She spots dead-end corridor with loading dock beyond, gets idea, lets him chase her
- Accelerates toward dead-end, Tony follows confident she's trapped, last second she handbrake-turns sideways and stops
- Tony can't react—Mustang hits her Camaro side-on at 50mph, both cars entangled, momentum carries them through wall onto loading dock
- Both cars teetering on edge over thirty-foot drop, Tony unconscious from impact, Casey conscious barely
- She crawls out window, both cars slide off edge, crash below, explode—massive fireball, Tony dies in explosion
- Casey on loading dock ledge watching Camaro burn (Danny's car, her weapon, gone), now on foot

**Dialogue Topics:** Tony's aggressive pursuit chatter, Casey's strained breathing and pain vocalizations, calculation about dead-end trap, physical effort crawling from car, watching explosion (brief eulogy for Camaro in her thoughts).

**Emotional Arc:** Desperate tactical thinking (trap or die), impact shock and disorientation, relief crawling free, grief watching Camaro burn (lost Danny's car again), shift to pure survival mode—finish on foot or die trying.

- Casey staggers from explosion, burns on arms, bleeding from multiple wounds, should be dead
- Calabrese's last two security guards (from follow car) find her, try to finish job
- She's unarmed, wounded, but they hesitate (she's legend, they're scared), she doesn't—grabs tire iron from ground
- Brutal close combat: beats first guard to death (smashes skull), takes his .45 pistol, shoots second guard (three rounds center mass)
- Collapses from exhaustion, blood loss, shock, everything goes black
- Wakes three days later in hospital under false name—racing crew found her (Tommy coordinated), anonymous drop, nobody talks to cops

**Beats:**
- Casey recovers one week in hospital, checks herself out against medical advice, Tommy picks her up
- Drives to garage, father waiting (also recovered), rare emotional moment—he hugs her (no words, just understanding)
- Racing circuit knows everything: Danny's sister destroyed Calabrese's empire, killed 36 people, avenged her brother, became legend
- Casey knows she can't stay Detroit—too many bodies, too many questions, cops sniffing around even without evidence
- Sells garage to Tommy ($30k), takes race winnings ($50k from final race), says tearful goodbye to father
- Leaves Detroit, drives west, can't look back
